# Progression

## Knowledge Systems

- 1 or more players can be assigned to a knowledge system: e.g. computer
- later game, players can create shared networks, by inviting other player's Knowledge systems to theirs and vice versa
- non-default two-way sharing
  - a player can have their system shared with you but you can disallow their system into yours so you can continue to independently work
- More advanced system needed for different levels of research

## Research

- when you discover something like a material or mechanic
  - Mechanics
    - you can create a law of X (basically noting its properties and how it happens)
    - you simulate it (dependent of tech)
  - Materials
    - you can research its properties
      - Different levels of analysis based on the tech in ur lab
        - Physical properties
        - molecular properties
        - atomic properties
    - you can experiment on it's uses (discoverable recipes)
- locations of importance on a planet or system
  - this can be you found something interesting lets mark it and sample stuff
  - found life????
